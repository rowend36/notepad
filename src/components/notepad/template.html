<h1>Welcome To Notepad</h1>
<i>Just a simple note taking app</i>
<p>Notepad is a simple app for jotting down stuff and the like. It allows basic markup and insertion of images/links.</p>
<h2>What makes it so special?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create notes right from your browser. Just type <a href="https://notepad.rowendduke.repl.co">notepad.rowendduke.repl.co</a></li>
  <li>No need to save anything, your note is encoded in the url and is persisted as long as you have the tab open.</li>
  <li>Bookmark your notes to store them for later use.</li>
  <li>Enjoy notes syncing to all your devices using your browser's sync.</li>
  <li>Need to duplicate a note. Just open in a new tab.</li>
  <li>Need to share a note. Just share as the URL in your address bar. Unfortunately, due to browser limitations, this only works for notes that are not too large. The limit varies from browser to browser.</li>
</ol>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make images shareable</li>
  <li>Allow exporting notes as markdown, pdf or jpeg.</li>
  <li>Add code highlighting</li>
</ul>
